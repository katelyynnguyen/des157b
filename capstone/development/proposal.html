    <h1>capstone project proposal</h1>

    <main>
        <h2>topic & target audience</h2>
        <h3>the future of technology, design, and the job scene</h3>
        <p>
            My topic revolves around the advancement of technology and I hope to highlight the jobs that have become obsolete due to the creation of new machines and technologies. I’d like to incorporate AI into it in some way since that’s a really big discussion/fear at the moment. My target audience is the general working class as well as tech companies. I think it’s great that technology is constantly evolving, but I think it would be helpful for companies to see how many people rely on these kinds of jobs in order to make a living. I hope that they’ll become more empathetic towards the working class and the people who make up their company.
        </p>

        <h2>working with a partner?</h2>
        <p>
            At the moment, I don’t plan on working with a partner.
        </p>

        <h2>lenses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>speculative design</strong></li>
            <li>challenging mental models</li>
            <li><strong>data visualization</strong></li>
            <li>utopian / <strong>dystopian narratives</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>features</h2>
        <p>
            I’m hoping to incorporate illustrations of people working the original jobs and what the jobs look like now. I’d also like to create a switch feature to show the before and after of the job and I’d like to be able to click on the illustrations to reveal some background information on the job and when it became obsolete. In order to indicate that the illustrations are clickable buttons, I’d like to have them glow or grow on hover. 
        </p>

        <h2>tangents, challenges, concerns</h2>
        <p>
            I’d like to include the design industry into my project somehow and it will most likely involve AI. I don’t want designers to get discouraged by AI taking over their jobs, so I might want to explore showing an illustration of designers using AI tools within their work. I also need to consider other paths for if I’m not able to illustrate the images well or if I don’t have the time to. My main topic for my brainstorming session was the future of design, so I was also thinking about splitting the page in half and the left side would be informative about what jobs have already become obsolete in the past, and the right side would be the future of design and speculating what jobs could or would become obsolete in the near future.
