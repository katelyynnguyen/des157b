            <div class="content">
                <p>My project focuses on the design industry and what the future may look like for it. As a graduating senior looking to work in the field, it can be intimidating with new technologies emerging and with people warning that jobs may become obsolete due to it. I wanted to research this topic more in order to provide myself and my peers with some reassurance that new tech advances will actually open up more opportunities for us rather than take them away.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p>My target audience is new designers who are just graduating or looking for a job within the design field. It can be very discouraging to hear from others that there isn't a future for design since there are technologies like generative AI that can replace us, but through my project, I want to let designers know that isn't the case. We don't have to be against new technologies either, we might even be more efficient if we work together with them.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>When doing research for thisi project, at the beginning, I was focused on the visual aspect of it and what kind of interactions I wanted to include. Many of the websites I explored focused heavily on storytelling and I thought that this was very useful for me since I wanted to present my information in that way. My project was going to be very information heavy and I thought that this was a great way to get my message across. Looking at these websites allowed me to think about the pacing of my information and how to not overload my user with too much info.</p>

                <p>Looking into the actual content of my project took me much longer than I had expected. I read a lot of articles about what jobs designers think are going to become obsolete in the future or what skills designers need to have in order to remain relevant within the design scene. Originally, I wanted my project to have graphics in order to compare what a design job looks like now and what it may look like in the future, but I didn't have enough time or bandwidth to be able to dive into that more. Looking at the AIGA Design POV Research Initiative suggested by Skye, who was part of my class's teaching team, was super useful. It provided me with a lot of the information and statistics that I was searching for.</p>

                <p>At the start of this project, I started to feel really burnt out and coming up with ideas that I thought were creative proved to be quite difficult for me. This is what lead me to do something a bit simpler, but still following the storytelling model that I originally wanted.</p>

                <img src="images/colors.jpg">
                <p>Since my project revolves around technology, I wanted to use dark and neon colors because that feels very tech and futuristic to me. I tried exploring using neon magentas and oranges on a dark background, however it just wasn't giving off the vibe that I wanted. I decided to look online for color palette inspirations and I landed on one that I thought fit perfectly. The darker blue background made it feel moody, but the other colors were more bright and playful and I think they balance each other out really well.</p>

                <p>Like I mentioned before, I was burnt out and in a creative block as this project was progressing so my vision for the final outcome wasn't very clear. At first I wanted to include a lot of data visualization aspects like charts, graphs, and illustrations, but it felt like I was putting more on my plate than I could handle at the time. I also struggled a lot with how to incorporate more interactive elements for the user.</p>

                <img src="images/sketch.jpg">

                <p>After having a discussion with my professor, Bill, I decided to keep my project simple and have the user scroll through one single page. I was still able to include some data visualization aspects, like the bar graph. To incorporate some more interactive elements I decided to add buttons and prompt users with a questions to respond to.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned before, I decided on a project where users scroll in order to reveal more infomation. Ensuring that users wouldn't experience cognitive overload was a major focus of mine. </p>

                    <p>I decided to go this route mainly because it was simple, while still looking visually clean, and I was unfortunately running out of time. I found that this was a great way to pace my information and I also didn't have too many visual aspects completed for me to work with. I utilized the Animate on Scroll library for my project and luckily there was no learning curve to this library. It was extremely straight forward and helped me to achieve what I was envisioning for my project at that time. I also decided to have all my text and elements centered because I felt like it created the best reading experience for users since it's quite inuitive.</p>

                        <li>Background: users are able to see how history tends to repeat itself within the tech world</li>

                <p>Unfortunately, I ran out of time to do user testing with my peers in class, so I wasn't able to get much feedback then. However, after presenting during our final showcase, the guests provided me with a lot of good suggestions for how I could improve my project.</p>

                <p>At the time, I had used an image for my chart as a placeholder because I wasn't yet able to figure out the Chart.js library yet, but thankfully, I got it to work exactly how I imagined. This was definitely a struggle and it was the most time consuming part of the coding portion of this project. During the time of my presentation, the buttons also didn't work. After going through some past examples that we had done in class, I was able to get it to work so that when you clicked on one, the color of the button would change and it only allows one button to be selected at a time. Depending on which button you select, the phrasing of the next paragraph also changes in order to be consistent.</p>

                <p>Overall, I'm not necessarily proud of what I've put together. It makes me sad that I fell into such a rut and I was unmotivated in order to complete this project. I'd like to thank my professor Bill for being so understanding and accomodating throughout this entire quarter. He was very helpful as he took the time to brainstorm some ideas to see if anything sparked my interest to get me to complete this project. I most definitely wouldn't have gotten this far without him.</p>

                <p>With this project, I am glad that I was able to explore using libraries more. It was my very first time and some were easier to use than others. For the Chart.js library, it was actually quite simple to input the data, but the styling portion is what consumed a lot of my time. In the end, I'm glad that I was able to present the graph in the way that I wanted to.</p>

                <p>In the future, I would like to continue working on the project to get all the buttons to present the information that aligns with that specific topic. In the "THE FUTURE" section, I would also like to include images for the examples provided so that users are able to get a better sense of what I'm talking about.</p>
