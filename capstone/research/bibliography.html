            Dodhia, Zaheer. “Council Post: Will the Demand for Graphic Designers Diminish in the near Future?” Forbes, Forbes Magazine, 5 Oct. 2023, www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/10/26/will-the-demand-for-graphic-designers-diminish-in-the-near-future/?sh=406d520c1e28. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This article talks about the future of graphic design jobs now that AI exists and is becoming more popular. Dodhia claims that although companies are turning more towards AI because they’re able to produce more content in a short amount of time, they will never be able to give companies and brands the human touch that graphic designers contribute. Currently, AI lacks the ability to transform key descriptors of the brand given by the client into content that is meaningful and encapsulates the vibes that the clients believe their brands possess. I think this article is important because it reinforces the fact that not all design jobs will be lost to AI, which can be very comforting to many creatives.

            Glenna. “Your Designer Job Will Become Obsolete If You Don’t Develop These Skills Today.” Medium, UX Planet, 24 Mar. 2020, uxplanet.org/your-designer-job-will-become-obsolete-if-you-dont-develop-these-skills-today-336b0d817187.

        <p>
            In this article, Glenna shares her thoughts about the design industry especially since concerns have been raised about job security due to the increased use of AI. Glenna states that she doesn’t believe your design job will disappear so long as you’re able to adapt and learn new skills outside of your typical skillset for the specific job. Learning how to code besides CSS and HTML, version control, design systems, metrics and data, and soft skills like communication will be key in insuring that your job remains safe and that you’re able to adapt as the industry constantly changes.

            Haynes, Billy. “25 Jobs That Will Disappear by 2030 Due to Ai and Tech.” 25 Jobs That Will Disappear by 2030 Due to AI and Tech, 13 Mar. 2024, www.careeraddict.com/disappearing-jobs.
        </p>

        <p>
            This article lists and describes 25 jobs they believe will become obsolete within the next few years due to technology advancements. Many of the explanations for why the jobs will become automated is due to the fact that machines are much more efficient in getting work done and also in terms of cost. The possibility of human error will also be greatly reduced. Lots more softwares are becoming available online that allows for users to be self-sufficient and do things on their own, such as tax preparation and self-publishing books on platforms like Amazon.
