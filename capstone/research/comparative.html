            I really like how this website tells a story while also including interactive elements. I also think the interactions on the site are very intuitive and it’s pretty similar to what I’m thinking of doing right now. I like the fact that you’re able to click on different objects within the room and the objects glow to show that you are able to click on them and after you’ve clicked on them, the glow effect goes away to show that you’ve already looked at it. I think this is a really cool feature, but I think I want to include a better way of showing that the user has already looked at it. I think removing the glow feature can affect usability in some way because is users aren’t paying attention, they may not know what object they clicked on to reveal certain information.

            Something that I really liked about this website was that part of the interaction was to get input from the user and it was included in the data that was displayed. This is something that I need to think more about in terms of my project. I liked how the interaction was simple yet engaging so it wasn’t overwhelming to the user and it didn’t scare them away that they had to input a lot of information. I also liked how the data was presented on a graph real time. The data points were added as more data was taken from more “people” and I thought it was really engaging and interesting to see the graph change as time went on. This might be something that I’m looking to include in my project in terms of stats of how many designers/creatives are concerned about job security and maybe my project can provide some sort of comfort to users that their jobs won’t become completely obsolete due to different factors.
