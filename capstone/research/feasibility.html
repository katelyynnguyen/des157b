    <h1>coding components and feasibility report</h1>

    <p>
        For my final project I want to explore the longevity of certain jobs in the design field due to the fact that AI is becoming a big part of technology and creatives are fearful that their jobs may become obsolete because of it. I want to have a “this or that” concept where I’m comparing two jobs (i.e. graphic designer vs UI/UX designer) to see which one will outlive the other due to technological advancements. I would also like to highlight different skillsets that current designers deem as crucial in order to continue having a job in the design industry. 
    </p>

    <p>
        On the first page, I would like to have lists displaying the job details of each job so that users are able to see the similarities and differences of the two. I would like to have each bullet point animate in at reasonable intervals so that it’s easier for users to digest the information. 
    </p>

    <p>
        On the second page, I plan to include charts in order to display different kinds of information. I’m leaning towards using a line graph in order to compare the job trends of graphic designers and UI/UX designers. I’d like to include a hover feature where when you hover along the line of the graph, a popup will present information such as what the job looked like at that time (maybe represented by different symbols or graphics if not a whole scene) and a description of what the job consisted of. This way, users are able to see the progression of the job over the years and how technology has affected it.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the third page, I plan to use a pie chart in order to display the various skills that current designers believe will be important in the future. The size of each section will be determined by how important that skill is considered to be. I think this is important for future designers because it shows them what skills are important in order to remain relevant. The fourth page will display what the jobs will look like in the future (maybe 10 years?). This page will be graphic heavy.
    </p>

        I plan to make use of the Chart.JS library in order to create my graphs. I’ve done some research and exploring of the library and it doesn’t seem too difficult to use. It also allows me to create different types of graphs with ease which is very helpful. To navigate between the pages I’ll have to use the addEventListener function in order to create buttons toggling back and forth between the pages. I’d also like to figure out how to get my text to animate. I’m not sure what kind of animation I’m exactly looking for, but possibly imitating the typing feel or the animation that looks like the words are appearing based on the flipping of a cube. This is something that I have to continue researching. I believe that a majority of these skills I either already have experienced, or it won’t be very difficult in order to learn how to use them and include in my project. Another thing that may be time consuming for me is drawing the graphics and figuring out how detailed I would like them to be.
